# Daycare Database
Fall 2020 Database Project

I.Business Scenario
 
A narrative description of the business used for the project or application being created. This should also include a description of the problem or opportunity being addressed.

Our daycare company has been operating in Brooklyn, New York for the past 10 years. Over the course of our business, we have realized that each child needs his/her proper attention, and that there are a lot of people, steps, and various moving parts in the process. Customers can sign up for certain programs, and plans, and it is our job to keep everything in order. We have been collecting information about our clients and children in an outdated way, in which we were heavily Excel and spreadsheet based. Now, as we continue to grow, we are looking for a new and more technological way to keep all of our information in an easy to navigate, and organized database. We are seeking to replace our previous manual method of tracking the business with a more efficient and scalable database where we can more easily store, manage, update, and retrieve our data. Through organizing our data in a more effective and automated way, we will be able to provide our customers with better service, and continue to grow our business as a whole. 

Identification of the information needs â€“ what information would help solve the problem or allow one to take advantage of the opportunity.

The information needed in order to take advantage of this opportunity, and create an efficient database includes customer information like name, cell phone number, address, etc. We will also need to know what the parents (customers) are looking for in terms of taking care of their child, such as what program/services they would like their child to be in, which meal plan they would need, toys they would want, how long the child would be at the daycare, medical needs and other specifications. It's also important to keep track of the different vendors the daycare would need supplies from, such vendors for food, toys and managing finances. In addition, we need to monitor the Employee of the daycare, such as their hourly wages/salaries, home address and contact information among other things.

Initial list of entities (tables) that have been identified. This should come naturally from the above discussions.

Some entities may include, but are not limited to:
Guardian
Child
Program
Employee
